Samina's Codeword Game

-----------------------------
Welcome to the Codeword Game! 
-----------------------------

This is a 2-Player game where you need to guess a secret word by guessing letters and checking if they match the numbers in the secret word.
Every number represents a secret letter, that will show up after every correct guess in your key grid. 
The winner is the Player with the highest health value!

How to Play:

1. Run the main.py file in your terminal. (I have already prepared the boot_up() function to launch the game, 
    so all you need to do is hit run!)
2. If you are an admin and want to login or create an admin account, you can select the Admin option which is choice 1. 
    That's if you're authorised and know the secret admin key of course! 
    For testing purposes, the admin key is my City Username: addj347
3. If you would like to play the game, select the player option. You can then either create an account, or login!
4. Once 2 players are logged in, the game will begin with Player 1's turn. 
    You will be displayed with a guessing grid, and the key below it. 
    Players will take turns guessing letters to try to guess a correct letter in the codeword.
5. A correct guess will +1 to the players 'correct' value, and +2 for the health value.
    An incorrect guess will +1 to the players 'incorrect' value, and -2 for the health value. 
    After every guess, the player statistics will be displayed so the players can keep track and get competitive!
6. Once the puzzle has been solved, the final player statistics will be displayed and the awesome champion will be announced!

Enjoy the game! Good luck!
